*Let's see how this goes!*

(To follow rules, daily solutions will be uploaded at a minimum of 24 hours after the challenge opens.)


## Table of Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge # | Challenge Summary | Solution Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
1 | You are given a list of values. Each group of values represents 1 Elf's calorie inventory. A single value is a single item's calorie value. An empty space is what separates each elfs' group of items from each other. **Find how much the elf with the most calories is carrying.** <br> <br> Part 2 asks you to **Find the total sum of the top 3 calorie carrying elves.**| <ol><li>Read file input</li><li>Format the data</li><li>Create elf inventory arrays and store them in an array</li><li>Create an array with all the sums of each elf inventory</li><li>Find the maxium value in the array of sums</li></ol>
2 | You're competing for points in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Your strategy for gaining points based on a shape for a round won is:<ol><li>Rock: 1 point</li><li>Paper: 2 points</li><li>Scissor: 3 points</li></ol> Your strategy for gaining points on the outcome of a round is:<ol><li>Lost: 0 points</li><li>Tie: 3 points</li><li>Win: 6 points</li></ol>Your strategy for playing is:<ol><li>A (Rock): Y (Paper)</li><li>B (Paper): X (Rock)</li><li>C (Scissors): Z (Scissors)</li></ol>**Find your total score based on the strategy.** <br> <br> *Part 2* Now you need to try making the outcome of the round based on the following: <ol><li>X: You have to lose </li><li>Y: You have to draw</li><li>Z: You have to win</li></ol>**You're still looking for a total score, but now you have a different strategy for winning, losing, and causing a tie.**| <ol><li>Read file input and format the data</li><li>Break down each line as an array containing 2 objects. Store these arrays into 1 overall array</li><li>Use some logic statements to provide responses to the input, such as what hand to play given a circumstance</li><li>Sum the total for that current round and add that sum to an overall game sum</li><li>Give the expected amount of points you'll obtain when following the given logic strategies </li></ol>
